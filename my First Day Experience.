My first day of school was a very interesting day. I have never floated and been as disoriented as i was on this day.First of all, i had not done the pre-course work to know about Ubuntu, brackets and committing. I thought committing was a bad thing!

My day began as interesting as it ended. First i went to fix my laptop whose hard disk had apparently gone kaput! So i get a scary call from my instructor at Moringa School asking why i wasn't in school for two days. Gasp! I hadn't even started and i had the feeling i wouldn't see it(Moringa School). So i called Kate, another instructor and told her my reasons for truancy and thank goodness she understood. So i decide that as late as i would be, i would still go to school and see how things were.

I get to school and everybody is staring at me. My heart skips a beat,no, actually beats ten times faster. I have to introduce myself in front of the class. So i say my name, why i was late and what i like doing. I see two familiar faces but other than that, i am a stranger in the seas of Moringa. 
Tamre, our instructor, tells people what to do, and i am terrified that if he finds out i did nothing at all, would chase me out of his class. I keep my cool, and act like i know what i'm doing, just to save my skin. I meet some people, nice ones actually. :-) They try to help me as much as i can. I was floating as well in Java Class and i felt pathetic, but aw shucks, how do you learn other than by encountering a setback.

I was so shocked when people were talking and answering the instructors, and i felt like i had missed school for a month! Shocker!

When we were split into groups, i quickly admitted that i didn't know anything, and thank the heavens for an understanding team. They basically left the easiest work for me, and i wanted to do it to the best of my ability and knowledge...which i think i obtained. I am proud of my team mates who i can call friends now.

I also met this wonderful human called Nelson, who really helped me with installations of all the apps i would need. Oooh what a great person to know.

After struggling a bit,i finally got a bit drill and did some web development. Wow, what a great interesting day. I got home and still couldn't believe how disoriented i was!
