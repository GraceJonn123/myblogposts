At first glance, i thought i had missed twenty weeks of school. What in the world is HTML? CSS? I was in awe, negative awe, because i didn't know what it was, what it entailed and how i was meant to use it. ..."use html and css animations"..."use  frameworks and please have it due in two days"..
What was the instructor saying?
I couldnt fathom what was going on around me, my computer was recovering from a meltdown, machine periods, and everyone was typing with their heads buried into their laptops. If i spoke, suddenly i was the liveliest, when i kept silent, darkness,gloom and conservation filled the air. Oh dear! What can a girl do?!
I had spent over three hours trying to figure out what HTML and CSS meant to notice how fast time was moving. So i took out my phone, God bless technology, and looked it up on google. With my high school mentality kicking in, i started cramming, not bothering to understand the meanings of what i was reading.
Two hours passed, and if you took me to an exam room, i was beaming with the confidence of success.
But something was missing..I didn't know what i was doing, i had to apply that knowledge!!
My first project, creating a contacts list for a group work project. Typing typing typing... Wow i'm getting the hang of this..
 Keeping at it. A few hours and i was pro!! Not really but yeah, thats how i learnt...the hard way.
