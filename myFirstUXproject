WOW!
This was the awesomest experience after so much floatation(floating in other classes). So we were assigned a project where we were to go out and interview five people of our choice and ask them about our coffee website that we were at the moment working on. We had gone about it in a group format. We would go to a restaurant as a group, split up into different teams and ask together. Although we went together our emails wouldn't match. So we went out and got some random humans to answer our questions. Some shyed away, others repelled us like a plague, but others were surprisingly very generous with their time, knowledge and humour which was sometimes wrongly placed. 
Anyway that was a good day, reminding us of how we are still human, irregardless of where we go. Nice project to change one's perspective.
