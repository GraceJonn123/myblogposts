Here are some of the ten things to do before MS:


1. Train on not to sleep!
You should come to MOringa when your brain is programmed for less, little or no sleep, because the work load will give you insomnia!

2. Get a balding hair cream or lock dreads!
For one you wont get time to go to a hair dresser, so get something convenient for your whole stay an MS.

3. Finish pre-course work!
If you don't, you will join the club of floatation. THIS IS KEY. ABOVE ALL ELSE HERE.

4. Get some good Headphones.
If you work around music, some good headphones will relieve the tension in the air. Equip yourself because you will not talk to busy humans!

5. Forget your phone exists!
Train yourself on how not to be addicted to your phone. i forgot about my phone in school yet before MS i was textaholic.

6. Learn to move around in ninja times.
Most times, students leave late and arrive early so teach yourself some self defence strategies that will help you navigate through ninja hours.

7. Get a crib in the vicinity.
This is obvious, basically for locomotion ease, easier access to school resources and for your own good. Don't get fatigued!
