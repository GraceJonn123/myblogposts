This was actually the scariest class i have been to since Moringa began. Our instructor gave us work, and as he was solving it on the board, a student came to correct the whole thing! 
!!!!!!!!!!!
What?!
I barely knew anything and someone was correcting an instructor! Perhaps MS wasn't for me.
I lost all the hope i had.
